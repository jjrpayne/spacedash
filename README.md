SpaceDash is a multi-platform game that I built using the libGDX framework.
The gameplay is simple, just navigate your ship by tapping the left and right sides of the screen (on mobile) or by using the arrow keys (on desktop/web).
The goal is to dodge pipes and earn the highest score possible. For more information and screenshots, see the Android release below.
